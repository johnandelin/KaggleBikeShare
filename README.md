# Kaggle Bike Share Analysis
This project originates from the Kaggle competition "Bike Sharing Demand." https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/overview 
I utilized this competition to demonstrate various machine learning techniques, including feature engineering and predictive analysis. 
All modeling and feature engineering were done through the Tidyverse and Tidymodels packages in R. 
The attached R script "Bikeshare analysis.R" shows my Tidymodels recipe and workflows. 
I used several different predictive models for this competition, including Linear Regression, Penalized Regression, Regression Trees, and Random Forests.
The predictive model that had the least amount of error was the Random Forests model. 
# Kaggle Bike Share EDA
These plots explore the relationship between the number of bikeshare rentals and some factors, such as weather, season, and temperature in Celsius. 
These plots were made using the ggplot2 and patchwork packages in R, shown in the attached R script "Bikeshare EDA.R".
# Data
All data for this project was obtained from the Kaggle website. 
# purpose 
This project was done for a university project in my predictive analytics (STAT 348) class at Brigham Young University. The goal of this assignment was to achieve a Kaggle
score below 0.4. I achieved a score of 0.396 using a Random Forests model. 
# considerations
Improvements can be made to this project to achieve a better Kaggle score. Things that could have been done include more feature engineering, 
such as creating more features that may have been obscured in the data, different or more complex models, such as advanced ensemble methods. I did not explore this
project further because I achieved the target score for this assignment.
